> The one-liner to spin up a code search engine

The `latest` tag query the Github API and download the latest release at **RUNTIME**, while the tagged version have pre-downloaded binary when building images. Choose wisely ;-p

[OpenGrok](http://opengrok.github.io/OpenGrok/) is a code search engine
made by Sun (and now Oracle).

It provides similar functions to [LXR](http://lxr.linux.no/) but much more.
This project encapsulated OpenGrok into a docker container, allowing you
to start an instance of OpenGrok by one command.

## Docker Image


## Usage

To start the OpenGrok, simply run:

```sh
docker run -d -v [source to be indexed on host]:/src -p [public port]:8080 ttimasdf/opengrok
```

It may take a while for the indexer to finish the first-time indexing, after
that, the search engine is available at `http://host:[public port]/source/`.

## Note

The project supports dynamic index updating through `inotifywait` recursively on the source folder.
This can be disabled with the environment variable `INOTIFY_NOT_RECURSIVE` at runtime.
Also, if you have more than 8192 files to watch, you will need to increase the amount of inotify watches allowed per user `(/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches)` on your host system.

NOTE: `touch` doesn't trigger inotify. You should add, delete or modify the content of some source file to make it happen.
